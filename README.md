# Capacity & Ticket Forecasting Model — v17.3
This repository contains the corporate_hybrid_forecast_v17_3 model, an end‑to‑end framework that forecasts ticket volumes for Payments, Partners, and Hospitality verticals, and generates department‑level operational capacity boards for Jan‑2026 → Feb‑2027.
The pipeline integrates forecasting engines (STL/SARIMAX), bias calibration, Einstein deduction, agent‑based capacity modeling, inventory enrichment, and a complete export system.

1. Overview
The model transforms raw ticket and agent data into:

Accurate monthly ticket forecasts
Einstein‑adjusted and bias‑calibrated demand
Agent‑driven capacity & productivity metrics
Department‑level operational boards
PowerBI/analytics-ready consolidated dataset

4. Forecasting Logic
4.1 Daily Engines
STL Baseline (default)

Weekly seasonality
Robust trend extraction
Log smoothing
Uses last 7 days pattern as fallback

SARIMAX‑7

SARIMA (1,0,1) × (1,0,1)_7
Log space modeling
Uses empirical residual variance

Selection rule:
Department → recommended engine (if exists) → else STL.

4.2 Monthly Aggregation





















StepDescriptionSummationDaily p50/p05/p95 → monthly totalsValidationEnsures: p05 ≤ p50 ≤ p95SmoothingReduces noise from irregular months

5. Einstein Deduction

6. Bias-Based Calibration





















FieldMeaningmape_pctMean Absolute Percentage Errorwape_pctWeighted Absolute Percentage Errorbias_pctSystematic over/under‑forecast
Calibration formula:
calib_factor = 1 - bias_pct / 100
Range: 0.70 → 1.30

7. Agents-Based Capacity & Productivity (v17.3 Key Upgrade)





















KPIDefinitionagents_gt1_dayAgents with meaningful targets (>1)target_mean_gt1_dayMean target of productive agentsprod_sum_dayTicket-equivalent productivity
Monthly metrics:
capacity_agents = mean(agents_gt1_day) * mean(target_mean_gt1_day)
productivity_agents = sum(prod_sum_day)


8. Capacity Consolidation
Priority:
capacity = agents_capacity if exists else historical_capacity
productivity = productivity_agents if exists else capacity

Future months:
Mean of last 3 months of historical capacity.

13. Limitations & Future Work

Backtesting not automated yet (manual Model_Used_and_Error)
No hierarchical reconciliation across departments
Ensemble method could be added
Agent productivity may require anomaly detection
Extended language‑based forecasting may be added (we intentionally ignore language per your specifications)
